# employee-creator

## MVP / Recommendations

We need a web application to create, list, modify and delete employees. The application should consist of a spring RESTful API and a React Typescript frontend. The schema for the employee is left to the criteria of the candidate.

The list can be a local database, CSV, TXT file or even in memory
Implementing an API logging strategy.
Implementing error handling strategy.
At least 3 endpoints are required:
To create an employee
To get a list of existing employees
To delete an employee

React Redux is recommended.
Typescript is recommended.
React hooks are recommended.
React create app is a good starting point.
You can include any other open source NPM library.
Feel free to use your favorite CSS framework.
Feel free to use your favorite middleware.
Add some basic validations on the form like required and max length validations.
The site should be responsive.

## Planning

- React Redux seems to function similarly to useContext React Hook. The application will still be built in TSX with vite. I think I'll need to use Middleware with RR.

- API has: create employee, list of existing employees, delete employee
- Front-end has: View Employee List (with delete option), Add Employee Form. Routed.
